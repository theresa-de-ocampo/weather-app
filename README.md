# Weathering with Ãœ - A Hybrid Mobile App

## Overview
Weather information is crucial to anyone who is working, or even if you are still just a student. It enables you to plan ahead, from the most trivial question of whether to bring an umbrella up to the knotty task of rescheduling important events. This project takes weather apps a step further by allowing users to connect with other people.
